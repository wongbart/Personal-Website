                    <p> As a Math student at UWaterloo I was required to take a Computer Science in each of my first two terms. 
                        That was my first experience working with code, but I quickly discovered that I really enjoy it and
                        I've since created some interesting applications.

                        <p>Battlesnake is a multi-player programming game. Players write a program to play the classic Snake game 
                            and the last player standing is the winner.
                            </p> 
                        <p> I developed 3 snake AI's in node.js and deployed them
                                using Heroku to compete in the Battle Snake global arena. 
                                I'm planning on creating an updated snake 
                                in Python. The code for all of my projects can be found on

                        <h2>Daily Change</h2>
                        <p>   Around the time that I was learning Python,
                              I was also looking for a way to track the 
                              daily changes of my overall investment portfolio. So, I decided to write a program 
                              that took in a portfolio of stocks and returned
                               the daily change alongside the usual information.

                        </p>
                        <p> This straightforward program simply takes in the desired tickers 
                            and the amount of stock owned and uses Yahoo Finance to
                            return the daily changes. It was a good introduction to Python 
                            and I've been able to make more complex programs since.

                        <h2>Go Battle League Simulator</h2>
                        <p> Originally I was choosing teams of Pokémon arbitrarily until I found PVPoke.com.
                            PVPoke rates teams of 3 based on their coverage, bulk, safety and consistency. 
                            After discovering this, I spent hours rating different combinations of 3 pokemon 
                            trying to find the optimal team. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I decided to write a Python script that 
                            takes in all of the Pokémon I have ready to use and runs every combination through PVPoke.
                            Then it returns every team in order from highest rated to lowest. 
                            Now, I'm able to run hundreds of team compositions in a few minutes instead of a handful in a few hours.

                        <p> This is my most recent project. It's built using HTML, CSS and
                            JavaScript and is hosted on the University of Waterloo's server. I'm planning 
                            on adding a page dedicated to GBLS and implementing a SQL database so that 
                            there's no need to run a team again if it's already been run by someone else. This
                            should increase the speed of the program. 
                        </p>
                        <p> I'll also be updating the photography page and adding any other projects 
                            here in the future. Thanks for visiting my website!</p>
